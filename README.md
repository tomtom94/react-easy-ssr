## Introduction

React App with SSR Server Side Rendering. Webpack 5 installed manually. In dev mode we use live reload thanks to `webpack-dev-middleware` & `webpack-hot-middleware` modules.

Main modules used are `redux-saga`, `loadable-component`, `react-refresh`, `react-jss` and `typescript`.

## Motivations

All this project is turned about SSR Server Side Rendering. And this is not an easy task. This boilerplate repository allows to overcome this work.

## Getting started

Clone the repo

```git
git clone https://github.com/tomtom94/react-easy-ssr.git
```

```git
cd react-easy-ssr
```

### Requirements

Node.js version v16.3.0 minimum (because we need to use the [js optional chaining operator](https://node.green/#ES2020)). Hopefully you got `nvm` command already installed (best way to install node), hence just do

```nvm
nvm use
```

it's gonna use the `.nvmrc` file with v16.20.0

### Start in dev mode

Get prepared with the env vars

```sh
cp .env-development .env
```

```npm
npm install
```

Run dev mode with

```npm
npm run dev
```

it's gonna start an hot dev middleware with an express server ;) ready to work `http://localhost:3000`

### Start in production mode

#### With Node.js

```npm
npm install
```

Write in your server provider the environment variables `BACKEND_BASE_URL`

Run build mode with

```npm
npm run build
```

it's gonna build in `dist/`

Then run in production mode

```npm
npm run start
```

;) it's gonna start the only one SSR express server out of the box for internet `http://localhost:3000` or environment port used.

#### With Docker

```docker
docker build -t react-easy-ssr .
```

```docker
docker run -p 80:80 react-easy-ssr
```

Then open `http://localhost:80`

## Must know about the app

You better use a good search engine like [Qwant.com](https://qwant.com), don't use Google. please.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

When pushing or merging on master branch, you can trigger Github Actions with a commit message that includes `#major`, `#minor` or `#patch`.

Example of commit message in order to start a deployment :

```git
git commit -m "#major this is a big commit"
```

```git
git commit -m "#minor this is a medium commit"
```

```git
git commit -m "#patch this is a tiny commit"
```

### Checks to do sometimes

- Check typescript `npm run tsc`
- Check eslint `npm run lint`
- Check prettier `npm run prettier`

### Components

The main rule is we don't use a frontend framework. All components come from wherever we need it, but we are not stick to one. No need of `material-ui`, no need of `bootstrap` etc... However we are used to copy past source code from them. For example we made a copy past of the wonderfull `material-ui` `<Grid />` which is so much powerful [check it out in this repo](https://github.com/tomtom94/react-easy-ssr/blob/master/src/components/Grid.tsx). We don't use many components that generate their own css stylesheet, because we need to control this carefully in order to make the famous SSR.

`style-components` and `fontawesome` modules are also installed if ever you wanna use it. And yes we care of them for the SSR also.

Please note we don't use classical CSS style. We use [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss) (it means js in css). `material-ui` module also uses `react-jss` this is why we didn't installed `material-ui` else it would be stupid to generate twice the `react-jss` stylesheet on the SSR, and inefficiente to make an ultra fast App.

Either you install `material-ui` and you make all your css components with it (which is recommended if you do this for big company), or you get free and install `react-jss` like we did.

### Data-fetching and SSR

Let's see how we fetch our data to feed our redux store. You can find this code in the `<Movies />` [component](https://github.com/tomtom94/react-easy-ssr/blob/master/src/views/Movies/index.tsx).

```react
const willMount = useRef(true)
if (willMount.current && !process.env.BROWSER) {
  dispatch(triggerMovies('GET_MOVIES'))
  willMount.current = false
}

useEffect(() => {
  dispatch(triggerMovies('GET_MOVIES'))
  return () => {
    dispatch(clearMovies())
  }
}, [dispatch])
```

- 1st part is only for server side, we dispatch the redux action : with `useRef` you can be sure the action won't be triggered multiple times in an infinite loop.
- 2nd part is only for client side, we dispatch the redux action : but when you trigger this action there is a [redux-saga selector](https://github.com/tomtom94/react-easy-ssr/blob/master/src/store/reducers/selectors.ts) which will check if data hasn't been already fetched during 1st part, if yes no need to fetch again. And we clear the error if there are some before leaving the component.

This way your App is able to fetch data on the server & client side independantly.

### ES6 Imports possible in JSX

Webpack setup only allows us to import files with ES6 in type

- .js .jsx .ts .tsx
- .png .jpe .jpeg .gif .ico
- .woff .woff2
- .css (remember `react-jss` generates its own stylesheet via its own plugins, not via webpack loaders)

You can add more Webpack `loader` to your project...
